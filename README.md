# Divvy-Trips-Analysis

In this analysis, I examine the dataset from the bike rental company Divvy. The dataset contains information about the rides, stations and customers. 
I will be exploring and analysing the dataset to extract information about the differences between their 2 types of customers, the Casuals and the Members.

Processes Done:
* Data Cleaning
* Data Wrangling
* Data Analysis
* Data Visualization

I have used Python as the programming language on Jupyter Notebook. The main libraries used are Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn.
